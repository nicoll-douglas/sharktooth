[Chores]
- do more testing to make sure current features are solid

[Release]
- implement an updater mechanism (electron-updater?)
- implement a build system for building application into a prod downloadable/release
- use GitHub releases
- Do application README
- Make sure we have an application logo desktop icon
- Add a link to release notes, bug reports, changelog (all will be on GitHub)
- test with a VM that the application works cross-platform
- Add developer documentation
- Add user guides + about

[Features]
- Extra download step in download feature where we can fetch album covers (MusicBrainz integration?) and render them for the user to select for metadata

- Set up button that lets user pause download queue
- Current download will go through but next download will be prevented (downloader loop stopped)
- Allow user to remove queued downloads if and only if the queue is paused
- Form with checkbox card selection for playlists
- Ask the user to confirm that a couple hundred tracks will be added to the download queue.
- Have a "syncs" page with real-time data similar to the downloads page for spotify syncs
- Have select field for playlist file output type
- Have checkbox field asking user if they want metadata pre-filled

[Improvements]
- make Spotify auth system more robust
- If a refresh fails then empty all tokens in the class and settings
- Investigate what kinds of responses the Spotify API will send back for refresh requests or requesting an access token for the first time
