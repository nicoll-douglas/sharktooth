[Chores]
- do more testing to make sure current features are solid
- make sure exceptions are handled gracefully (add try catch for Spotify API requests and look at response codes)
- backend logging
- Need to show empty state if there are no playlists

[Features]
- Extra download step in download feature where we can fetch album covers (MusicBrainz integration?) and render them for the user to select for metadata
- Fill in artist name and track name metadata in download flow from youtube search form

- When the user submits the playlist download form, fetch all tracks and queue all of them.
- Have a "syncs" page with real-time data similar to the downloads page for spotify syncs
- In the database we will have syncs and downloads ties to syncs
- Render the syncs and real-time data on the syncs page
- Allow the user to cancel a sync only if download loop is paused
- When a user cancel's a sync, we remove all queued downloads related to that sync from the db
- We also have playlists in the db so that we can render data about that
- For tracks who's download fails, we also need to render that data in the sync (e.g x failed tracks, y successful)
- Limit syncs to only one at a time the same way with downloads

[Release]
- implement an updater mechanism (electron-updater?)
- implement a build system for building application into a prod downloadable/release
- use GitHub releases
- Do application README
- Make sure we have an application logo desktop icon
- Add a link to release notes, bug reports, changelog (all will be on GitHub)
- test with a VM that the application works cross-platform
- Add developer documentation
- Add user guides + about
