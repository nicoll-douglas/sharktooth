## Real-time API

### /downloads

#### Client-sent Event: `get_downloads`

Subscribes to live updates about the current state of downloads in the application.

##### Client to Server

No payload needs to be sent.

##### Server to Client

The payload will include live updates about downloads in the format below. The initial payload will contain data about all downloads of all statuses and then subsequent payloads will only include incremental updates about any reactive changes to updates i.e status changes, progress changes.

```
DownloadUpdate[]
```

For example, initially we may receive the following payload on the client which includes data about a track currently being downloaded and a previous failed download:

```
[
  {
    "download_id": 1,
    "old_status": null,
    "status": "failed",
    "downloaded_bytes": 2445143,
    "total_bytes": 5932894,
    "speed": 218054.09873454241,
    "eta": 4,
    "artist_names": ["Daft Punk"],
    "track": "Around the World",
    "codec": "mp3",
    "bitrate": 320,
    "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwDns8x3Jb4",
    "created_at": "2025-09-27 22:08:01",
    "completed_at": null,
    "failed_at": "2025-09-27 22:08:07"
  },
  {
    "download_id": 1,
    "old_status": null,
    "status": "downloading",
    "downloaded_bytes": 5203235,
    "total_bytes": 5221585,
    "speed": 210754.56577849746,
    "eta": 1,
    "artist_names": ["Daft Punk"],
    "track": "One More Time",
    "codec": "mp3",
    "bitrate": 320,
    "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2VpR8HahKc",
    "created_at": "2025-09-27 22:08:12",
    "completed_at": null,
    "failed_at": null
  }
]
```

Then on the next update, we may get the following payload only containing data about the track that was being downloaded which has now completed:

```
[
  {
    "download_id": 1,
    "old_status": "downloading",
    "status": "completed",
    "downloaded_bytes": 5221585,
    "total_bytes": 5221585,
    "speed": 210754.56577849746,
    "eta": 1,
    "artist_names": ["Daft Punk"],
    "track": "One More Time",
    "codec": "mp3",
    "bitrate": "320",
    "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2VpR8HahKc",
    "created_at": "2025-09-27 22:08:12",
    "completed_at": "2025-09-27 22:08:15",
    "failed_at": null
  }
]
```

Data about the failed update would not be included in this update and subsequent updates since it would not have many or any reactive changes, unless the download was say for example, retried.
